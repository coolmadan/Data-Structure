//Normal hashmap (ordered) is internally implemented using red black trees
/*
The only difference between map and unordered map is that In map (ordered) insertion is done in an order which can be either 
increasing or descending but in unordered map the insertion is done as the input comes
TIME COMPLEXITY :
INSERTION :
MAP : Ordered Map takes O(log n) times to insert as it compares the input and the already existing map and inserts according to the values
UNORDERED MAP : Unordered map takes O(1) time in order to insert as it insert based on the order
DELETION/ERASING: 
MAP: O(log n)
UNORDERED MAP : O(1)
FIND :
MAP : O(log n)
